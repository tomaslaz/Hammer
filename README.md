# Description
Hammer is written in Python and based on the mpi4py MPI implementation. It is designed as a client/server model to efficiently perform multiple computational jobs, i.e. to automate repetitive/mundane computational tasks, typically required to perform task farming, data mining, data analysis etc. Hammer can be run on a local machine or an HPC cluster, if the installed MPI compiler supports MPI_COMM_SPAWN command.

# Requirements 
Python v.2.7.x (x => 9)

mpi4py v.2.x (x => 0.0)
